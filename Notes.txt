SECURITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DB connection info saved to config.php which should be placed 
  outside of document root 
	--> In case of PHP env. failure cant retrieve that file

- All passwords hashed with sha256 and salt

- Function mysqli_escape_string() used to prevent SQL-injections

- Function htmlentities() used to prevent XSS-attacks

- Errors handled properly but no mysqli_error() printed since it can provide
  valuable information to attacker

- Information can be updated only when old password is entered
	--> Preventing session stoles

USABILITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Large buttons and a lot of space between input fields
	--> Touchscreen friendly design

- Registration form will restore entered data if username is reserved
