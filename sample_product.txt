01.jpg	OPTi SERIES			OPTi reels come in a wide variety of sizes, each optimized for specific fishing applications.

02.jpg	EVOTEC G4 SERIES	The Evotec Reel series have, at long last, been re-designed. More unique than ever with the L-shaped logo that ties 							together our line of fly reels.

03.jpg	CLASSIC series 		The Classic is equipped with ventilated sideplates in the new 2011 version. Beneath the stunning looks of the new 								Classic fly reel is the ultra-modern Power Matrix Drag System.

04.jpg	MULTi series 		We have always been known for designing the highest quality fly reels on the market. So when we set out to create a 							series of diecast reels, we knew they had to be built to the same standards as our other great reels.  

05.jpg	XACT series 		Our new and improved version of the Evotec CLW. The Xact reel is made from composite, except the reel foot, handle								and drag knob that is made from aluminium. This reel is simply made for tough conditions.

06.jpg	Cross S1 			The new Loop Cross S1 fly rod series is the single most important revolution to occur in fly fishing since we 									introduced the large arbor reel over 20 years ago. It’s that big.

07.jpg	Opti Creek 			The Opti Creek series has been optimised for sensitive fishing on small water. If you are looking for the ultimate 								rod for small technical water, then get Optimised with the Opti Creek series. 

08.jpg	Booster				If big toothy critters is the name of your game, the Booster is the rod for you. With a deep progressive action the 							Booster delivers big flies as easy as nothing.

09.jpg	Incite Kit			All our flyfishing sets are built on the concept that matched, balanced tackle is critical to the learning process. 							This easy to cast flyrod set provides everything required to develop and most importantly – to catch fish!

10.png	Opti Stream			Opti Stream is precisely as the name indicates: for flowing water. The new taper is designed for extreme ease in 								both underhand and overhand casting.

11.png	Opti Stillwater		This line is designed for bigger streams and lake fishing. The taper enables long casts and is designed to set the 								fly down with precision at distance. 

12.png	Opti 130 Distance 	Opti 130 Distance is the line for long distance casting. The long belly and adjusted taper gives a fine balance 								between delicate presentation and very long reach.
